## Purpose & Scope

### What the application will do:

In this application, when the user first launches the application, they will be asked to input a username for themselves. The user will not be able to enter an invalid username such as no input or white spaces. If this does occur, the program will prompt the user to enter a valid username containing at least one character be it letter, number, or symbol.

Once a valid username has been entered, the program will then loop into the main menu for the application. Here the user can choose to enter the battle simulator, view how the game works, or exit the application if they so choose.

When the option to enter battle is selected, there will be a short piece of text that will appear as if the computer is typing a message to the user stating that they cannot be defeated. The user will then be prompted to choose from one of three different monsters to use in the battle. The computer will then choose one of the three monsters at random to use against you.

The monsters will all have a name and two differently named moves. All monsters will have a maximum health of 100 for the first battle and the moves each monster knows will have the same damage across all monsters with move 1 having 10 damage, and move 2 having 15 damage.

The battle will begin by the application prompting the user to select one of the two moves to use against the opponent and then the opposing monster's health will be reduced by the amount of damage of the selected move. When a move is selected, there will be a 10% chance of the damage being a critical hit, reducing the health by an extra 10 points. The program will then move on to the computer's turn, where one of the moves will be selected at random and the same critical hit chance applied. This process will keep repeating until one side's health reaches zero or becomes less than zero.

If the user is victorious, a message will display congratulating them on their win, the computer will type a message stating that they will not be defeated next time. A win counter will then be applied to the username so if they wish to battle again without closing the application, the computer will have a different response when the battle first begins.

I am developing this application to solve the problem of boredom and also to introduce people to the very basic levels of a pokemon-style battle.

The target audience for this application is people looking for some form of entertainment in the means of a small quick game.

A member of the target audience would use this application to pass the time and also to understand the basic concept of a pokemon-style battle.
